                     <h3>AMERICAN SNIPER</h3>

<p>U.S. Navy SEAL Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper) takes his sole mission -- 
    protect his comrades -- to heart and becomes one of the most 
    lethal snipers in American history. His pinpoint accuracy not only saves 
    countless lives but also makes him a prime target of insurgents. 
    Despite grave danger and his struggle to be a good husband and father to 
    his family back in the States, Kyle serves four tours of duty in Iraq. 
    However, when he finally returns home, he finds that he cannot 
    leave the war behind.
